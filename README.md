#### A Continental and Marine-Influenced Tree-Ring Mercury Record in the Old Crow Flats, Yukon, Canada

Eccles, K.M.,  Majeed, H., Lehnherr, I., Porter, T. (2020). A Continental and Marine-Influenced Tree-Ring Mercury Record in the Old Crow Flats, Yukon, Canada. ACS Earth Space Chem.

Gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) concentrations in the atmosphere have been increasing due to anthropogenic activities since the onset of colonial mining in the 17th century. However, accurate measurements of atmospheric Hg, including temporal trends, are mostly limited to recent decades. Natural environmental archives including tree rings show promise for reconstructing atmospheric concentrations of Hg0. In this paper, we present a new white spruce (Picea glauca) tree-ring Hg record (1696â€“2005) from the Old Crow Flats in northern Yukon. The record we present shows an increase in tree-ring Hg concentration (a proxy for gaseous Hg0 concentration) between 1748 and 1990 at a rate of +3.3% per year. A decrease in measured Hg is observed at the end of the record between 1990 and 2005, which may reflect the success of international regulations to reduce emissions including Hg. When compared with two other sites (a continental and marine location) in northwest Canada, there is not only some coherence in Hg trends at the regional scale but also some unique differences, suggesting that the location may influence atmospheric Hg0 available for assimilation. Further local factors within a site, such as soil moisture, may also affect the efficiency of this uptake. Results from this study highlight the need to better understand intra-site and inter-site differences in measured tree-ring Hg, and we recommend the continued development of a spatially resolved tree-ring Hg network in the northern boreal forest. Such records will be useful for developing better atmospheric Hg and global Hg models.

Must run bias_adjustment.R to adjust raw data for individual tree bias

For plotting, complete_dataset.R must be run first to convert the dataset from 5-year data into yearly data
